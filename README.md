# HealthFusion
HealthFusion has identified a critical business problem, which is the lack of accessibility and timely detection of multiple diseases. The traditional approach of detecting diseases is time-consuming, expensive, and not accessible to everyone, especially in remote areas. This problem can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can have serious consequences for patients.

The proposed solution, HealthFusion, is novel and practical as it offers a comprehensive solution to detect multiple diseases using the power of AI. HealthFusion is a user-friendly app that can be accessed from the comfort of homes, making it accessible to everyone. The use of advanced technologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost allows for accurate and timely detection of diseases, leading to better patient outcomes.
